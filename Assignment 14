- Was the book used in this course effective/helpful?  Would you recommend a different one?
  I found that finding references online were easier than reading the entire chapter of the book. 
  There were some references that I was unable to find on the Internet though that I did need the book for.
  The book was helpful none the less though and holds alot of important information.

- Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
  The topics that were covered helped me understand how the OS breaks down the "higher level" languages. 
  There was not any specific topics that I was looking to learn though in assembly.

- How can this course be improved?
  I think you did a very good job in presenting material and preparing the students for the homework. 
  You also were able to  setup the students with the ability to begin a project when other professors/instructors 
  would have just expected you to know how. I cannot recall what the prerequisites are but it would help understanding 
  the projects we are writing up in the higher level language as well so we have some sort of reference. I know you did that
  on a couple assignments and had us break down each function into assembly.
