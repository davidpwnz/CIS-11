1. Using the value –35, write it as an integer literal in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary
formats that are consistent with MASM syntax.

2. (Yes/No): Is A5h a valid hexadecimal literal?

3. (Yes/No): Does the multiplication operator (*) have a higher precedence than the division
operator (/) in integer expressions?

4. Create a single integer expression that uses all the operators from Section 3.1.2. Calculate
the value of the expression.

1. What types of files are produced by the assembler?

2. (True/False): The linker extracts assembled procedures from the link library and inserts
them in the executable program.

3. (True/False): When a program’s source code is modified, it must be assembled and linked
again before it can be executed with the changes.

4. Which operating system component reads and executes programs?

2. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit unsigned integer.

3. Create an uninitialized data declaration for an 8-bit signed integer.

4. Create an uninitialized data declaration for a 64-bit integer.

5. Which data type can hold a 32-bit signed integer?

- [ ] 3.5.5 Section Review Question 3
3. Write a statement that causes the assembler to calculate the number of bytes in the following
array, and assign the value to a symbolic constant named ArraySize:
myArray WORD 20 DUP(?)

4. Explain why the term assembler language is not quite correct.

5. Explain the difference between big endian and little endian. Also, look up the origins of this
term on the Web.

6. Why might you use a symbolic constant rather than an integer literal in your code?

25. Which data directive creates a 32-bit signed integer variable?

4. Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative
value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?

7. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.

13. Declare a string variable containing the word “TEST” repeated 500 times.

1. Integer Expression Calculation
Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write a program that calculates the
following expression, using registers: A = (A + B) − (C + D). Assign integer values to the EAX,
EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.
